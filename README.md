# The Vision
I would love to have an app which _anyone_ can use on pretty much _any device_ and which gives us all access to a _wide range of talks_ given by Buddhist teachers.

The website http://dharmaseed.org/ offers a great resource for desktop browser users, and they have a useful [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dharma-seed/id507779665?mt=8), but nothing for Android.
