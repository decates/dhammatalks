_An app for listening to Buddhist talks on any device_

Wondering what '_Dhamma_' is? In this context it means the teachings of the Buddha. [Read More...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhamma)

# The Vision
An app which _anyone_ can use on pretty much _any device_ and which gives us access to a _wide range of talks_ given by Buddhist teachers.

The website http://dharmaseed.org/ offers a great resource for desktop browser users, and they have a useful [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dharma-seed/id507779665?mt=8), but nothing for Android.

The app is open-source in the hope that a community can build around the app to sustain the flow of new ideas and build valuable new features into it over time.
